## üí° Purpose & Origin

This project was born out of a personal need to calculate my student loan payoff. As someone who always wanted to dive into Python, I saw this as the perfect opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. What started as a simple console application evolved into a full-fledged web tool, available for anyone to use (as long as it's not for profit).

The primary goal of this repository is to exhibit my empirical Python programming abilities and my journey from a console app to a web application. By making this project public, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in developing practical, real-world applications using Python and modern web technologies.

## üíº Loan Terms and Concepts

This calculator uses advanced loan concepts to provide the most accurate results possible. Some key points to understand:

1. **Interest Priority**: In most loans, your payments first go towards satisfying the interest before reducing the principal balance. This is crucial for understanding why early payments have a smaller impact on the principal.

2. **Principal Reduction**: Any amount paid beyond the required payment may go towards reducing the principal, but only if applied correctly (see note below).

3. **Compound Interest**: The calculator factors in how interest compounds over time, giving you a true picture of the total cost of your loan.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Additional Payments

In real-life scenarios, making additional payments doesn't automatically reduce your principal. To ensure extra payments are applied to the principal:

1. üìû Contact your lender before making the additional payment.
2. üó£Ô∏è Explicitly state that the extra amount should be applied to the principal balance.
3. ‚úÖ Follow up to confirm the correct application of the payment.

If you don't take these steps, the lender might treat the extra payment as an advance on your next regular payment, which won't reduce your long-term interest payments.

Remember: Understanding your loan terms is crucial. If you're just learning about loans, think of it like a piggy bank that gets hungrier over time. The sooner you feed it (pay it), the less hungry (interest) it gets! üê∑üí∞
